### 1.3 Phone Script

**Template P-PH-01: Discovery Call Script**

```
Introduction:
"Hi {{firstName}}, this is {{callerName}} from PL Capital.

I sent you an email last week about our quantitative PMS partnership opportunity. Do you have 10 minutes to chat?"

[If NO]: "No problem! When would be a better time?" [Schedule]

[If YES]: "Great! Let me give you a quick context..."

Value Proposition:
"PL Capital is an 80-year-old investment firm. We've pioneered India's first quantitative PMS strategies - MADP and AQUA. Our AQUA strategy delivered 76% returns in its first year.

We're expanding our partner network and I thought your practice at {{companyName}} could be a great fit."

Discovery Questions:
1. "Can you tell me about your current client base? How many HNI clients do you work with?"

2. "What's your current product basket? Do you currently recommend PMS to any clients?"

3. "What are the biggest challenges you face in growing your AUM and retaining clients?"

4. "What would make a PMS partnership attractive to you? Commission structure, product performance, support?"

Objection Handling:
[If "My clients are happy with MFs"]:
"That's great! Actually, PMS isn't meant to replace mutual funds. Think of it as the next step for your top 20% clients who've accumulated ₹50 lakh+. It's about offering them a premium alternative as they grow their wealth."

[If "Commission isn't clear"]:
"Fair question. Let me be transparent: You earn [X]% upfront + [Y]% trail. On a ₹1 Cr client, that's approximately ₹[Z] lakh in Year 1. I can send you the detailed commission grid right after this call."

[If "Too busy to add new products"]:
"I completely understand. That's why we've made the onboarding incredibly simple. We provide ready-made client presentations, handle all documentation, and assign you a dedicated relationship manager. You just make the introduction."

Closing:
"Based on our conversation, I think there's definitely a fit here.

Next step: I'd like to send you our partnership brochure and schedule a 30-minute call with our Partner Success Manager who can walk you through:
- Detailed commission structure
- Onboarding process
- Sample client cases

Does [Day/Time] or [Day/Time] work better for you?"

[Schedule and confirm via email immediately]

Thank You:
"Thanks for your time, {{firstName}}. You'll receive the brochure in the next hour. Looking forward to our detailed discussion on [Date]!"

Subject: For {{firstName}}: How Quant Investing Generated 37.5% Alpha in 2024

Hi {{firstName}},

Hope you're doing well!

I'm Siddharth Vora, Fund Manager at PL Capital. I wanted to share something that might interest you given your role at {{companyName}}.

**The Challenge Most HNIs Face:**

Despite strong economic growth, many HNI portfolios delivered only 10-12% returns in 2024. Meanwhile, systematic quantitative strategies generated significantly higher alpha.

**Our AQUA Strategy Case Study:**

→ **76% returns** in Year 1 (launched Jan 2024)
→ **37.5% alpha** vs BSE 500 benchmark
→ Achieved through systematic, bias-free investing
→ Zero emotional decisions, 100% data-driven

**The Quant Advantage:**

Traditional investing suffers from:
- Recency bias (buying high, selling low)
- Confirmation bias (ignoring contrary data)
- Loss aversion (holding losers too long)

Quantitative investing eliminates these through systematic frameworks.

**For You:**

I've prepared a special report: **"The Quant Edge: How India's Top HNIs Generate Consistent Alpha"**

It covers:
✓ The 6S framework powering AQUA
✓ How quant strategies work in Indian markets
✓ Real portfolio examples (anonymized)
✓ Tax-efficient wealth creation

[Download Your Copy: PDF link]

No obligation, no sales pitch. Just valuable insights from 80 years of market experience.

If you find it valuable, I'd be happy to discuss how PL Capital can help optimize your portfolio.

Subject: The 6S Framework: How India's Top HNIs Invest Systematically

Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on the report I shared earlier. Did you get a chance to review it?

Today, I want to introduce you to something unique - **The 6S Framework** that powers our AQUA strategy.

**What is the 6S Framework?**

It's our proprietary quantitative model that makes investment decisions based on 6 systematic factors:

1. **Sentiment** - Market mood indicators
2. **Style** - Value, Growth, Momentum signals
3. **Sector** - Rotation patterns
4. **Size** - Large, Mid, Small cap allocation
5. **Sustainability** - Quality and stability metrics
6. **Signal** - Entry/exit triggers

**How It Works:** [3-minute explainer video link]

In this video, I walk through:
- How the framework identifies opportunities
- Real examples from 2024 portfolio
- How it adapts to market changes
- Why it beats traditional active management

**Why This Matters to You:**

If you're currently investing through:
- Mutual funds (manager bias risk)
- Direct stocks (emotional decisions)
- Traditional PMS (concentrated bets)

The 6S Framework offers a systematic alternative that:
✅ Removes emotional bias
✅ Adapts to market regimes
✅ Targets consistent alpha generation
✅ Manages downside risk

**Exclusive Opportunity:**

We're offering **10 portfolio reviews this month** where I personally analyze your current portfolio and show you how quantitative strategies could enhance your returns.

No cost, no obligation. Just 30 minutes of insights from someone who's managed ₹500+ Cr using these frameworks.

- Portfolio value: ₹1.76 Cr

- Alpha generated: ₹38 Lakh vs mutual funds
- Education corpus goal achieved 3 years early

- ₹50 Lakh+ in underperforming mutual funds

Subject: Are You Making These 5 Investing Mistakes?

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question: Have you ever...

❌ Sold a stock in panic during a market crash (only to see it recover)?
❌ Held onto a losing investment hoping it'll "come back"?
❌ Bought a stock because everyone was talking about it?
❌ Sold a winner too early because you wanted to "lock in profits"?
❌ Let emotions drive your investment decisions?

If you answered YES to any of these, you're not alone.

**These are cognitive biases** - and they cost Indian investors crores in lost returns every year.

**The Solution: Quantitative Investing**

Data-driven, systematic, bias-free investing that:
✓ Removes emotional decision-making
✓ Follows tested, repeatable processes
✓ Adapts to market conditions
✓ Generates consistent returns

Subject: How to Generate 15% Returns Without Emotional Bias

Hi {{firstName}},

Most investors aim for 15-18% returns but end up with 8-10%.

Why?

**Emotions.**

Let me explain with a real example:

**Case Study: Rahul, 38, Software Engineer**

*What He Did:*
- Invested ₹10 lakh in direct stocks (2019)
- Portfolio up 40% by early 2020
- COVID crash → panicked and sold everything (March 2020)
- Re-entered market in late 2021 (near top)
- Lost 20% by 2022

*Final Result:* -8% over 3 years (when Nifty gave +35%)

**What Went Wrong?**

Not stock selection. Not timing. **Emotions.**

1. **Greed** (held winners too long)
2. **Fear** (panic-sold at bottom)
3. **FOMO** (bought at top)

**The Quant Alternative:**

Our AQUA strategy achieved 76% in the same period by:

✓ Following systematic rules (no emotions)
✓ Rebalancing based on data (not feelings)
✓ Cutting losses early (rules-based)
✓ Riding winners longer (systematic exits)

**The Difference?**

**₹10 lakh → ₹9.2 lakh** (Rahul's approach)
**₹10 lakh → ₹17.6 lakh** (AQUA approach)

₹8.4 lakh difference. Same market. Different approach.

**Want to Learn the Quant Way?**

I've created a free resource: **"Introduction to Quantitative Investing"** (20-min video + PDF guide)

You'll learn:
→ What is quant investing
→ How systematic strategies work

Subject: How a VP at {{similarCompany}} Built ₹3 Cr Wealth with PL PMS

Hi {{firstName}},

I want to share a story that might resonate with you.

**Meet Priya (name changed)**

- 42 years old
- VP at a large tech company
- ₹55 LPA salary
- Similar to your profile (based on LinkedIn)

**Her Situation (2021):**

- ₹75 lakh in mutual funds (10% CAGR over 5 years)
- ₹25 lakh in FDs (5.5% returns)
- ₹18 lakh in direct stocks (inconsistent returns)
- **Goal:** Build ₹3 Cr corpus for early retirement by 55

**Her Frustration:**

"I don't have time to manage my portfolio actively. Mutual funds give okay returns, but I need better if I want to retire early. I don't know how to improve."

Sound familiar?

**The Transformation (Jan 2022):**

Priya invested ₹50 lakh in PL Capital's AQUA PMS.

**Why AQUA?**

✓ Systematic (no time needed from her)
✓ Quant-driven (data > emotions)
✓ 15-18% CAGR target (vs 10% MFs)
✓ Transparent (quarterly calls with fund manager)

**The Results (Dec 2024):**

| Investment | Amount | Current Value | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| AQUA PMS (Jan 2022) | ₹50 L | ₹1.18 Cr | 34% CAGR |
| MFs (continue) | ₹25 L | ₹32 L | 11% CAGR |
| FDs (liquidated) | - | - | - |
| **Total** | **₹75 L** | **₹1.50 Cr** | **26% CAGR** |

**Her Reaction:**

"I wish I'd switched sooner. The mental peace of systematic investing + superior returns is exactly what I needed. No more stress about timing markets."

**Early Retirement Goal:**

Previously: ₹3 Cr by 2033 (11 years at 10% CAGR) → Looking difficult

Now: ₹3 Cr by 2028 (4 years at current rate) → Achievable!

**Could This Be You?**

If you're:
- Earning ₹30+ LPA
- Have ₹50 lakh+ to invest
- Want systematic, professional management
- Seeking 15-18% CAGR
- Short on time for active investing

PL Capital's quant PMS could be your solution.

### 5.3 Objection Handling Email

**Template G-OH-01: "Fees are too high"**
```
Subject: Re: Your question about PMS fees

Hi {{clientName}},

Thanks for your question about fees. It's important to understand the complete picture.

**The Math:**

Let's compare two scenarios:

**Scenario A: Mutual Funds**
- ₹50 lakh investment
- Expense ratio: 1.2% per year
- Distributor commission: 1% upfront
- Returns: 12% CAGR (after expenses)
- Value after 3 years: ₹70.25 lakh

**Scenario B: PL Capital AQUA PMS**
- ₹50 lakh investment
- Management fee: 2% + 20% performance fee (above 10%)
- Returns: 18% CAGR (net of all fees, based on backtest)
- Value after 3 years: ₹82.14 lakh

**Difference:** ₹11.89 lakh more wealth with PMS (despite "higher" fees)

**Why?**

Because fees matter, but **net returns matter more**.

Would you rather pay lower fees and get lower returns, or pay fair fees for significantly higher returns?

**Our Philosophy:**

At PL Capital, we eat our own cooking:
- Performance fee only kicks in above 10%
- If we don't beat 10%, we don't earn performance fee
- Your interests = Our interests

**Plus:**

For your investment size (₹{{amount}}):
- Negotiable fee structure available
- Volume discounts for ₹1 Cr+ commitments
- Fee waivers during promotional periods

Want to discuss a customized fee structure for your situation?
