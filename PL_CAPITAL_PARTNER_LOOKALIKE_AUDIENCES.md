- **Vintage:** Typically 10-20 years (established but stagnant)
- **Location:** Maharashtra (40%), Gujarat (20%), Karnataka (15%), Others (25%)

- Service deterioration (scaled too fast, quality dropped)
- Technology lag (clients moved to Zerodha/Groww)
- Compliance issues (SEBI penalties, reputation damage)
- Market timing (onboarded in bull run, lost in crash)
- Geographic mismatch (opened in tier-3, market wasn't ready)

**Engagement Indicators:**
- Low PL engagement (quarterly or less)
- Outdated technology (no CRM, manual processes)
- Minimal marketing activity (no events, no social media)
- Revenue decline YoY (20-40% drop)
- High dormancy alerts in PL systems

**Intervention Strategy:**
1. **Diagnosis (Month 1):** PL senior leadership audit + root cause analysis
2. **Remediation (Month 2-3):** Fix issues (hire RM, upgrade tech, rebuild trust)
3. **Execution (Month 4-6):** Custom reactivation campaign + PL co-investment
4. **Target:** 30-40% reactivation = 300-600 clients per partner

**Internal Data Signals (PL Systems):**
- Partner dashboard: Activation rate trending down
- Client login data: <20% clients logged in last 90 days

Congrats on [X] policies sold in 2024!

But you know the challenges:
❌ Declining commissions (IRDA cuts, online term competition)
❌ One-time revenue (no trails, no recurring income)
❌ Hard to cross ₹10-15L annually (even as top agent)

Top insurance agents are diversifying:
→ Add Mutual Funds (₹50 Cr SIP book = ₹25L trails annually)
→ Add Equity Trading (100 clients × ₹50K brokerage = ₹50L)
→ Add PMS (10 clients × ₹1 Cr × 1.5% = ₹15L commission)
→ Total revenue: ₹8L (insurance) + ₹25L (MF) + ₹50L (equity) + ₹15L (PMS) = ₹98L

Partner with PL Capital:
✓ Keep your insurance business (we don't touch it)
✓ Add MF, equity, derivatives, PMS (new revenue streams)
✓ Leverage existing clients (they already trust you)
✓ Training & certification (we fund NISM, AMFI)
✓ Technology platform (CRM, trading, mobile app)

50 MDRT agents partnered with PL in 2024:
